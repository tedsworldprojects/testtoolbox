## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîß Resistor Color Code Decoder
- **Instantly decode** the value and tolerance of both 4 and 5-band resistors.
- **Flexible Input**: Simply type in the color sequence (e.g., `"brown black orange gold"`) to get a beautifully formatted resistance value (`"10.0 kŒ© ¬±5%"`).
- **Wide Range**: Handles resistance values from Ohms to Gigaohms, automatically formatting the output for readability.

### ‚ö° Ohm's Law Calculator
- **Effortlessly solve** for voltage (V), current (I), or resistance (R).
- **Intuitive Calculation**: Enter any two known values, and the calculator will compute the third. The calculated field is highlighted for quick identification.
- **Robust**: Includes error handling for invalid calculations, like division by zero.

### üîã Standard Capacitor Value Lookup
- **Quickly find** the closest standard capacitor values from the common **E12** and **E24** series.
- **Practical for Design**: Input your desired capacitance (e.g., `"0.1uF"`, `"4.7nF"`, `"25pF"`) to see the nearest commercially available options, saving you time during component selection.

### üìú Persistent Calculation History
- **Never lose your work!** The app automatically saves your last five calculations to your browser's local storage.
- **Detailed Log**: Each history entry clearly displays the tool used, your original input, and the calculated result.
- **Easy Management**: A "Clear History" button is available to reset the log.
